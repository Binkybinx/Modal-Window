# Modal-Window

The Modal Window Project helped me undertsand how to implement the following:
- **Working with Classes in the DOM**:
  - Learned how to manipulate HTML elements using classes with the help of the `classList` API.
  - **`classList.add()`**: Added classes to elements to control styling and behavior dynamically.
  - **`classList.remove()`**: Removed classes from elements to modify their appearance or state.
  - **`classList.contains()`**: Checked if an element already has a specific class, useful for conditional logic.

- **Using Key Events to Interact with Classes**:
  - Learned how to respond to key events, like **`keydown`**, to hide elements by adding a class (e.g., `hidden`) when a specific key is pressed.
